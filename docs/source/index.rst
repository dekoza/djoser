REST implementation of `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ authentication
system. **djoser** library provides a set of highly customizable endpoints
built with custom solution based on
`Django Rest Framework <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_
to handle basic actions related to user account.

It works with `custom user model <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/>`_
as long as it correctly implements the ``django.contrib.auth.base_user.AbstractBaseUser``
interface.
